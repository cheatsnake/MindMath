An improved version of my old app for training oral counting. Now the application is built on the React. The application has modes for training a separate mathematical operation, whether it is addition, subtraction, multiplication or division. And there is also a mode with random operations. The length for each operation can now be adjusted independently, thereby choosing the optimal level of complexity for yourself.

Now you can pass the time usefully :)

## :fire: Features

- 5 different modes
- Setting the size of the numbers
- Simple design, dark theme
- Adapted for mobile devices
- Good for the brain
- Build on React with Redux & Styled-components
